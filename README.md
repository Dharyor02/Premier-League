This topic, **Premier League 2022/2023 season** was approved as my Project after completion of my Data Analysis course. It explores match stats, player and team performances, top scorers to defensive records alongside with the dashboard to give the analytic representation of the data and statement of the problem

## Problem Statement

1.	Poor performance of some teams in the premier league
2.	How Number of Touches affect the General Performance of a Team
3.	Accessibility and Usability: Current analytics platforms may lack user-friendly interfaces or accessibility features, hindering the ability of stakeholders to easily navigate and interpret the data.
4.	Limited Predictive Insights: While historical statistics are readily available, there is a gap in leveraging this data to generate predictive insights and forecast outcomes for upcoming matches or seasons.
5.	Complexity in Data Interpretation: With a vast amount of data available, there is a challenge in distilling actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions for clubs, coaches, and fantasy football enthusiasts

## Data Sourcing

The above problems played a major role in getting this data from the Premier league website and FBREF.COM
The data contains 6 Sheets/tables:
-	Defensive premier_league_stats: 20 rows, 19 columns
-	Player premier_league_stats: 568 rows, 18 columns
-	Possession_premier_league_stats: 20 rows, 23 columns
-	Squad_premier_league_stats: 20 rows, 27 columns
-	Squad_premier_league_stats(2): 20 rows, 12 columns

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This data was effectively cleaned and transformed using Power query editor of Power Bi.some of the steps are;
1.	Addition of a new column, Goal Conceded which was sourced to enhance effective analysis of the data.
2.	Changing of column names to enhance better understanding of the data e.g 'poss' as 'Possession', 'Att Gls' as 'Attempted Goals', 'Ass' as 'Assisted Goals' and lots more

## Data Modeling

The different sheets/tables are automatically connected by Power BI in a star schema(one to many). The Defensive_premier_league_stats is the fact table. The other tables are called dimensions table and are connected to the fact table.

This Chart provides us with the top 5 goal scorers in the 2022/2023 season with Erling Haaland having the most goals,36 followed by Harry Kane,30 goals and others. The number of goals scored by a player in a season simply means the number of times a player hits the back of the net and contributes to their teamâ€™s success by putting the ball past the opposing Goalkeeper. Goal scorers are often praised for their skill, accuracy and ability to create scoring opportunities.

This Table gives an insight on the Top 5 players with highest number of Goal Assists during the 2022/2023 season. Assists is the number of time a player directly contributes to a goal by providing a pass or assist to a teammate who scores. It measures the ability of a player to set up goals for their team. With Kevin De Bruyne at the top having 16 Goal Assists, this simply shows that he has 	the highest contribution to goals scored through out the 2022/2023 season.

## Top 5 Teams with most Possession

When a team has more possession, they have more control over the ball and can dictate the pace of the game.
